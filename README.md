# HISTORY

I wanted to re-arrange the ls output just like one can do with the -printf
option to GNU find. Sadly, there are no -printf option available for ls, so I
threw together a quick hack called 'pilsner' that did what I wanted and nothing
more, nothing less. Not very useful to others.

Mattias Svanstr√∂m crafted together the 'l' application which did basicly the
same thing but more elegant and with a nice twist; it calculated relative
mtimes.

I really liked that idea, but there were a couple of annoyances, so I forked the
project and added a configuration file, support for flags that'll control the
different views and possiblity to ignore certain files.
